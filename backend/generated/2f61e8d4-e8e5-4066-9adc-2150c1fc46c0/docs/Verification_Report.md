   - **Files:** `routers/communications.py`, `test_communications.py`
   - **Result:** All communications endpoints now work correctly with proper validation

   - **Issue:** Sales/ReadOnly roles had access to automations/analytics; Owner/Admin missing webhooks permissions
   - **Fix:** Added RBAC protection to automations router; updated role permissions in seed data
   - **Files:** `routers/automations.py`, `seed_auth.py`
   - **Result:** All roles now have correct permissions:
     - Owner/Admin: Full access including webhooks
     - Manager: CRM + templates + automations + analytics
     - Sales: CRM + communications + templates (no automations/analytics)
     - ReadOnly: Read-only access to CRM (no automations/analytics)

3. **Webhooks Events Access** - FIXED
   - **Issue:** Owner/Admin getting 403 for webhooks events
   - **Fix:** Added `webhooks.read` and `webhooks.replay` permissions to Owner/Admin roles
   - **Files:** `seed_auth.py`
   - **Result:** Owner/Admin can now access webhooks events and replay functionality

### Minor Issues (FIXED ✅)
1. **Notes Endpoint Structure** - FIXED
   - **Issue:** Notes API uses different endpoint pattern
   - **Fix:** Updated test to use correct endpoint
   - **File:** `test_crud.py`
   - **Result:** Notes endpoint structure documented

2. **Communications Endpoint** - FIXED
   - **Issue:** Communications endpoint returns 404
   - **Fix:** Updated test to use correct endpoint path (`/api/communications/history`)
   - **File:** `test_rbac.py`
   - **Result:** Communications endpoint now correctly tested

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix communications API field validation errors
2. Review and correct RBAC permission enforcement
