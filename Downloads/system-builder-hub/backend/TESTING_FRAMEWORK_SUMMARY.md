- `mock_playwright` - Mock Playwright for UI testing

#### Sample Data:
- `sample_spec` - CRM domain specification
- `lms_spec` - Learning Management System specification
- `helpdesk_spec` - Helpdesk system specification
- `large_spec` - Enterprise-scale specification (50 entities, 10 workflows)
- `security_test_spec` - Security-focused specification
- `sample_artifacts` - Generated code artifacts
- `sample_evaluation_report` - Test evaluation results

### 4. Golden Tasks Library

Comprehensive test scenarios covering:
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with bulk operations
- **Authentication**: User registration, login, password management, MFA
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration, payment flows, refunds
- **File Management**: Upload/download, validation, access control
- **Workflow Automation**: State transitions, triggers, scheduled tasks
- **AI Features**: Copilot responses, RAG functionality, recommendations

### 5. Testing Tools and Automation

#### Test Runner Features:
- CLI interface with multiple options
- Coverage reporting (terminal and HTML)
- Parallel test execution
- Pattern-based test selection
- Verbose output and debugging

#### CI/CD Integration:
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Multiple Python version support (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- PostgreSQL and Redis service containers
- Automated linting, security scanning, and testing
- Coverage reporting and upload

#### Build Automation:
- Makefile with common commands
- Docker support for containerized testing
- Development environment setup
- Documentation generation

### 6. Documentation and Best Practices

#### Comprehensive Documentation:
- Detailed README with usage examples
